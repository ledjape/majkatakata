      <h2>Welcome to BLW with Katerina</h2>
      <p>Hello and welcome! My name is <strong>Katerina Galiƒá</strong>, and I am a certified instructor for complementary feeding of newborns according to the <strong>Baby Led Weaning (BLW)</strong> method. Through this space, I share knowledge, guidance, and everyday inspiration to support parents who are curious about this beautiful, natural way of introducing food to their little ones.</p>
      <p>The BLW approach is more than just a feeding method‚Äîit is a philosophy that encourages babies to discover food on their own, at their own pace. It respects their independence, instincts, and natural curiosity. With BLW, babies learn to pick up food, bring it to their mouths, and explore different tastes, textures, and colors, all while building important motor skills and confidence.</p>
      <p>In recent years, images of tiny babies holding big pieces of food have become common on social media. Yet here, in our community, BLW is still a relatively new practice. Many parents approach it with curiosity, but also with questions, doubts, and even fears. My mission is to offer clear, practical, and evidence‚Äëbased answers‚Äîwhile encouraging parents to trust their children‚Äôs natural abilities.</p>

    <section id="why" class="section container">
      <h2>Why BLW?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidence &amp; independence:</strong> Babies lead the process, making mealtimes fun and empowering.</li>
        <li><strong>Family connection:</strong> They sit at the table with everyone else, sharing the same food in an age‚Äëappropriate way.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy habits:</strong> Without distractions like screens, babies learn to listen to their bodies and enjoy real food.</li>
        <li><strong>Developmental benefits:</strong> From hand‚Äìeye coordination to chewing skills, BLW strengthens essential abilities while keeping feeding joyful.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Addressing Common Concerns</h3>
      <p>Many parents worry about choking or the messiness of self‚Äëfeeding. Research shows that babies following BLW are not at higher risk of choking compared to spoon‚Äëfed babies. What‚Äôs important is following safety guidelines, preparing food correctly, and creating a calm environment for meals. The ‚Äúmess‚Äù may seem overwhelming at first‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a vital part of learning. Every squish, spill, and smile is a step toward growth.</p>
